# temple game

This is my first version of my first python game. There are three "temples": two squares and a circle. After hitting each temple a certain number of times, the temple explodes. After destroying all three temples, the winning message is shown. You can only destroy the temple with your laser, which fires every second. Make sure not to run into the temple, because then you will get a Game Over screen. Good Luck and I hope you enjoy my first game!
